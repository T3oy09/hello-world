# hello-world
First repository 

I was an electrician for a long time, got shocked and hurt a lot and decided to quit.
I became a photographer & took the self-employed route. Not doing really good there.
So I decided to learn how to code to get a better opportunity to do what I want to do which is travel.
I just started to learn Python. Bought a book & picked up some online courses in Udemy.
So far so good.
